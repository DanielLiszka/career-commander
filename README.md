## Database

A MySQL database server will have to be available and you will need root access to create the database. It is suggested that you grant privileges to another user with access only to that one database.

Then, store that username and password in the .env file in the root of the application folder. Once logged in as root execute the schema.sql file in the MySQL shell (source ./db/schema.sql) to create the database career_commander_db.

Once that is done, exit the shell and edit the server.js file to change sequelize.sync({ force: false }) to sequelize.sync({ force: true }). Save the file and start the server (npm start).

This will create the tables; only if you have entered the proper credentials in the .env file. Next, stop the server (control-C) and edit the server.js file again to change force: to false and resave the file. Restart the server (npm start) and you should be good to go. The server can be found on you local system at http://localhost:3001/.

<!-- . The database may be empty when you first run the application. If that is the case, you will need to create a new login. Click on Login and and enter a new username and password. Passwords must be at least 8 characters.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ``` -->
