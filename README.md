## Installation

This project will be running on Heroku. So, no real installation will be required. You just have to execute the URL: https://career-commander.herokuapp.com/.

All the application source code can be found at https://github.com/DanielLiszka/career-commander. If you want to run the application locally, you will have to install the following npm packages in the folder holding the clone of the above repository: mysql2(npm i --save mysql2), sequelize(npm i sequelize), express(npm i express), express-handlebars(npm i express-handlebars), express-session(npm i express-session), connect-session-sequelize(npm i connect-session-sequelize), dotenv(npm i dotenv --save), and bcrypt(npm i bcrypt ). Rather than install all these packages individually, you can just run "npm i" after you clone the respository including the package.json file.

A MySQL database server will have to be available and you will need root access to create the database. It is suggested that you grant privileges to another user with access only to that one database. Then, store that username and password in the .env file in the root of the application folder. Once logged in as root execute the schema.sql file in the MySQL shell (source ./db/schema.sql) to create the database career_commander_db. Once that is done, exit the shell and edit the server.js file to change sequelize.sync({ force: false }) to sequelize.sync({ force: true }). Save the file and start the server (npm start). This will create the tables; only if you have entered the proper credentials in the .env file. Next, stop the server (control-C) and edit the server.js file again to change force: to false and resave the file. Restart the server (npm start) and you should be good to go. The server can be found on you local system at http://localhost:3001/.

## Usage

This application will be run from Heroku at the following URL: https://career-commander.herokuapp.com/
. The database may be empty when you first run the application. If that is the case, you will need to create a new login. Click on Login and and enter a new username and password. Passwords must be at least 8 characters.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
